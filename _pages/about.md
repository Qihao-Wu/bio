I am a PhD candidate supervised by Prof. Yong-Hong Kuo in the Department of Data and Systems Engineering, the University of Hong Kong. 

My research focuses on Data-driven Decision-making, Markov Decision Process, Reinforcement Learning, Forecasting, and Optimization for applications in Healthcare Operations Management. 

Before my PhD, I received an MSc in Computational Methods from Imperial College London and a joint BEng in Mechatronics from the University of Wollongong and Beijing Jiaotong University.
