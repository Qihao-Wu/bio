Hi! Welcome to Qihao's page : )
======
I am a PhD candidate supervised by [Prof. Yong-Hong Kuo](https://sites.google.com/site/yonghongkuo/) in the [Department of Data and Systems Engineering](https://www.dase.hku.hk/), the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). 

My research focuses on Data-driven Decision-making, Markov Decision Process, Reinforcement Learning, Forecasting, and Optimization for applications in Healthcare Operations Management. 

Prior to my PhD, I received an MSc in Computational Methods from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) and a joint BEng in Mechatronics from the [University of Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au/) and [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.njtu.edu.cn/).

Apart from my research, I have a wide range of interests, including Quantitative Finance, Formula Student Racing, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Tennis.
