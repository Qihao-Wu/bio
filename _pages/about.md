Hi! Welcome to Qihao's page : )
======
<br/>

I am a PhD Candidate supervised by [Prof. Yong-Hong Kuo](https://sites.google.com/site/yonghongkuo/) in the [Department of Data and Systems Engineering](https://www.dase.hku.hk/), the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). Also, I was a visiting PhD student collaborating with [Prof. Abdel Lisser](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/u/lisser-abdel/) in [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en/), [Université Paris Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/).

My research focuses on Data-driven Decision-making, Markov Decision Process, Reinforcement Learning, Interpretable Machine Learning, Forecasting, and Robust Optimization for applications in Healthcare Operations Management.

Prior to my PhD, I received an MSc in Computational Methods from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) and a joint BEng in Mechatronics from the [University of Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au/) and [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.njtu.edu.cn/).

Apart from my research, I have a wide range of interests, including Quantitative Finance, Formula Student Racing, Medicine, and Tennis.
