From 2023 to the present, I have led a group of Research Assistants, Research Interns, MSc, and Undergraduate students to conduct research projects around AI and healthcare informatics. Some selected outcomes are targeted at high-quality academic journals (co-first author). For example,
* Data-driven Prediction of Inpatient Length of Stay in Hong Kong Emergency Departments,
  with Zhaoyun Cai (HKU MSc), etc.
* Causal Inference with Electronic Health Records,
  with Yijun He (HKU BSc), etc.
* Time Series Forecasting of Patients' Arrivals and Discharges,
  with Rayan Rahman (HKU BSc), etc.
* Non-invasive ABP Synthesis from PPG via CNN-LSTM-Attention and its Multi-Model Time Series Forecasting,
  with Bo Hu (HKU MSc), etc.
